						<h4 class="title">How Could I Tell Them the Truth?!</h4>
						<p class = "byline"> <strong>By: Bianca Delgado</strong> | March 16, 2016 | Richmond, CA</p>
						<hr>
						<img src="https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/v/t1.0-0/p526x296/12647560_10102616790362931_3270313262875234676_n.jpg?oh=50df570da376c068a428731c87f2e672&oe=573C7A55" height="300px"/>
						<br/>
						<p>You are shopping for clothes with your friend and they are trying many pieces on. When they come out of the dressing room, they are wearing the ugliest shirt you had ever seen and they ask, &ldquo;How does this look??&rdquo; This is the moment you take into consideration whether you want to lie and boost their self-confidence by telling them they look great. This would not only make them feel like they have a great taste in clothing, but it would make you look like a supportive and kind friend. Your second option: the truth. At this moment, you are going to determine whether your friend wastes money on a hideous shirt and embarrasses themselves in public. This situation may have varied in your life, but without a doubt, this has happened to everyone. The question is: Would you throw your morals away for your friend&rsquo;s feelings? </p>
						<p>People lie for all kinds of reasons. Some, like in the scenario above, lie in order to protect someone&rsquo;s feelings. According to PsychologyToday.com, aside from protecting others we also lie to protect ourselves, our interests, our image, and our resources. Whatever the situation, lying has a negative connotation in today&rsquo;s society. This makes people rethink whether they will do it or not, even if the intentions are positive. &ldquo;Treat others how want to be treated&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liar liar pants on fire&rdquo; are sayings that children are taught to think about in order to prevent them from creating bad habits as they grow up and whether that tactic actually works can be put up to the test. Recently, I hosted a Twitter poll in which the question was &ldquo;What is your opinion on lying?&rdquo; They were able to vote between A)It&rsquo;s great! B)Oh my! It&rsquo;s horrible, and C)Depends on the situation. After 12 hours and 19 votes, 95% voted &ldquo;Depends on the situation&rdquo; and  they 5% voted &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly fine.&rdquo; After the poll, I began to think of what the voters that chose Choice C would do in the scenario described above. Even though these answer choices may be seen as fairly dramatic, they were chosen in that manner purposefully. I wanted to clearly show that just like these choices are dramatic, after you choose to lie/tell the truth, the responses you receive are also pretty dramatic. </p> 
						<p>Going back to the first example, let&rsquo;s say you choose to lie to your loved one in order to preserve their feelings. &ldquo;It looks really nice! Why have we never seen that earlier?? Gorg!&rdquo; This expression immediately makes your relationship untrustworthy. Also, not to mention, you would be doing them a disservice. Now let&rsquo;s say you decide to tell your loved one the truth. &ldquo;You know what? I know you really love that shirt, but I honestly think we can find you one that suits more your style.&rdquo; This will save them from a fashion problem and show the immense trust you have between each other. Who knows? Maybe they&rsquo;ll even decide to let you know next time you are going to be in public making a fool of yourself just because your friends were not real enough to tell you the truth. Try telling the truth next time and if that doesn&rsquo;t work, then try the &ldquo;sugar coated truth&rdquo;... and lie.</p>

						<h4 class="title">How much Starbucks Coffee Should We Consume?</h4>
						<p class = "byline"> <strong>By: Ariana Ortega</strong> | March 2016 | Richmond, CA</p>
						<hr>
						<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/d3/Starbucks_Corporation_Logo_2011.svg/1017px-Starbucks_Corporation_Logo_2011.svg.png" height="300px"/>
						<br/>
						<p>The human population tends to depend on coffee on a constant basis that it has become a substance we cant live without but where do we draw the line to limiting our caffeine intake for the sake of the coffee pickers. For example, Starbucks is a very popular chain of coffee and it has over 60 million consumers a week. However, one doesn&rsquo;t think about the working conditions Starbucks coffee pickers in Costa Rica and Guatemala go through. Coffee pickers working under the Starbucks chain are paid $1 to $1.50 a day at the most.  A dollar a day can barely buy you a pack of gum without taxes included. With they&rsquo;re pay, they may even have children who deserve an education, yet cant do so because they have to help they&rsquo;re parents in coffee picking because the wages earned isn&rsquo;t sufficient for they&rsquo;re family. </p>  
						<p>One has to take into account about whether buying Starbucks Coffee benefits the human population. We will be able to pay four dollars for a tall sized frappuccino and spend around 300-400 dollars a year yet a coffee picker at the most gets payed 500 dollars a year. If you think about it, there are 60 million consumers a week meaning there are 2400 million a month and each one spends 300-400 dollars a year. Now with that in mind, Starbucks only pays its coffee pickers around a dollar a day, $500 a year and its baristas $12 an hour making $96 a day. </p> 
						<p>With these numbers in mind, should we still consume Starbucks on a daily basis or should we watch our caffeine intake especially from Starbucks. From this question, a poll was taken and 0 percent believed we should stop drinking Starbucks, 20 percent believed we should keep drinking Starbucks, and 80 percent believed we should drink Starbucks in moderation. Students from Making Waves Academy gave their in put about this question and Elizabeth Sanchez, a senior, said &ldquo;its unfair,&rdquo; and that we should put our ignorance aside and not ignore the fact that this is an issue which can be changed. </p>
						<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard about how much revenue Starbucks makes a year, and in fact it owns Seattle&rsquo;s Best Coffee and Peet&rsquo;s Coffee and Tea which are also two striving coffee chains in our nation. We see that it is at the top of all coffee chains in the industry making around 16.45 billion a year as of 2014. Vanessa, also a senior at Making Waves, said that &ldquo;Starbucks yet can&rsquo;t afford to pay their coffee pickers well&rdquo; knowing that they make &ldquo;billions a year&rdquo; and being a very &ldquo;successful company in the industry.&rdquo; Now she only drinks around four Starbucks drinks a year allowing us to see that yes, Starbucks should be consumed in moderation because of how little coffee pickers get paid. Jeannett, senior, is a Starbucks lover, when I mean lover I mean she consumes Starbucks on a daily basis. Well Jeannett didn&rsquo;t know about how coffee pickers get paid a dollar a day and she even gave us some insight in which workers should &ldquo;deserve getting paid a lot more and have safer conditions&rdquo; allowing them to work under the right protection for they&rsquo;re families. She even stated that she will begin drinking Starbucks in moderation. </p>
						<p>Now with everything in mind, is it morally right to continue drinking Starbucks Coffee at our current caffeine intake or should we moderate and seek our coffee chains where they coffee pickers are paid fairly? From the poll and student perspectives, it is advised to moderate our Starbucks Coffee intake knowing that workers should be paid a lot more when the company is making almost 20 billion dollars a year. </p>

						<h4 class="title">Richmond Resident Perspective</h4>
						<p class = "byline"> <strong>By: Melissa Garibay</strong> | October 2015 | Richmond, CA</p>
						<hr>
						<img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/radiofreerichmond/pages/865/attachments/original/1445460772/Melissa_Garibay.jpg?1445460772" height="300px"/>
						<br/>
						<p>My name is Melissa Garibay and I am a Richmond resident. I am currently in 12th grade at Making Waves Academy Public Charter School. </p>
						<p>Often, as I do my homework I hear sirens of an ambulance as someone is being rushed to the hospital. Every day as I get on the public transportation bus to get to school, I have to pass the West County Detention Facility. On my way back home, we sometimes stop to pick up an ex-convict who was just released around the time I go home. </p>
						<p>I am as much a part of this city as anyone else, even if I go to a public charter school. I live the same experiences as any other student my age. Why should people be denied being a part of the Richmond Promise simply because their parents wished for an education that would better prepare them for the college education? </p>
						<p>I will be attending college next year. What is making this very difficult is that college tuition and loans are rising every day. My parents work extremely hard but they will not be able to cover all of my college costs at this rate. The thought of being penalized for seeking alternative educational opportunities, like attending a charter school, is frightening. It is my hope that my community might help me throughout this process, not push me back. </p>

						<img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/radiofreerichmond/pages/857/attachments/original/1445284325/Arturo_Castaneda.jpg?1445284325" height="300px"/>
						<br/>
						<p>I am Arturo Castaneda, a Senior Representative at Making Waves Academy. I have been part of the Richmond community for over 15 years of my life, which has shaped the person I am today. Living in the Richmond community has driven me to work hard every single day, getting me to where I am today. </p>
						<p>My accomplishments have been carving my path to go to Santa Clara University, my dream college. However, there is a very large obstacle to reach my destination: paying $60,000 for the tuition and all other materials necessary for my life in college. That is a very high price for college, and it makes me worry that I won&rsquo;t be able to reach my dream. My family puts in a lot of effort to earn money, but it is going to be very hard for them to support me financially with college. As the cost for education increases, it demands for more loans, leaving many students in debt for many years.  </p>
						<p>Knowing that the Richmond Promise exists in my community, I know that it will be a very huge benefit to my family, my friends, and myself. Charter schools, such as Making Waves, should not be excluded from receiving the Richmond Promise Scholarship. Growing up in Richmond has not been easy on my life. I see many students&rsquo; dreams of going to college crushed because they are unable to afford it.  Recognizing what I am surrounded by makes me worry at times if I am going to be able to make it to college or not. </p>
						<p>Sometimes I get scared and think to myself, <i>Am I going to end up like my friends?</i> I do not want to go into debt by taking out so many loans to be able to afford college, because I do not want to live life paying off college. Receiving the scholarship will provide not just extra support for me, but also for my family. The money that I receive from the scholarship will help me lower the percentage of taking out a loan, preventing me from paying interest.  </p>
						<p>My family will also have fewer worries about affording college because, with the extra support, they won&rsquo;t have to worry about my dreams being crushed. They will have very big smiles on their faces, because they know that the scholarship creates a very high probability of me being able to afford college. The Richmond Promise Scholarship will make many students very happy, placing smile on their faces. Please include Charter schools into the Promise because we are students who also have a lot of potential to succeed. </p>

						<h4 class="title">NonRichmond Resident Perspective</h4>
						<p class = "byline"> <strong>By: Abril Ortega</strong> | October 2015 | Richmond, CA</p>
						<hr>
						<p>In August 2014, it was announced that Chevron was giving the city of Richmond a check for $35 million. A final decision on how that money will be distributed will be made before the end of 2015. I understand that there are disagreements on which students should receive the help from this check, but there isn&rsquo;t any need for these disagreements. All students that are Richmond residents should be entitled to receive this money because it would be unfair for only some to get the money based on factors like the type of school the students attend. Charter schools were established with the purpose of bringing educational justice to the families that had not been given this by the district. Although charter schools might not be part of a district, they are still public schools. Therefore, Richmond residents that attend a charter school are still public school students and have the same need for the Richmond Promise as any other resident that attends a non-charter public school.</p>
						<p>I am not a Richmond resident, but I do attend a charter school in Richmond, Making Waves Academy. Most of my peers are Richmond residents and I will stand up for them and say that they deserve the Richmond Promise as much as any other public school student. The students at my school all work hard as they are given rigorous school work every day of the week because they want to better their lives and the lives of their families. They see education as the key to their success, so they make sure to do everything they can to guarantee their acceptance to a college once they graduate high school. </p>
						<p>My peers are exposed to the same struggles and dangers that any other student living in Richmond faces. A friend of mine lost her uncle in a shooting in front of Richmond High School not that long ago. Her parents knew that they wanted my friend and her siblings to receive a better education, where they would be safe and have the opportunities that would eventually result in a bright future. As a result my friend and her older brother were enrolled in Making Waves Academy. My friend&rsquo;s brother graduated last year with a high GPA and an acceptance to a top university. Unfortunately, my friend&rsquo;s family could not afford it and her brother was unable to attend the college of his choice. It would be devastating if the same thing would happen to my friend. However, I have hope that the City Council will make the best choice by providing the Richmond Promise for ALL Richmond residents. These financial issues might not be completely resolved with the help of the Richmond Promise, but they would sure be a step closer to being fixed. Charter students have struggles and dreams just like any other students, so my peers should not be penalized by not receiving the Richmond Promise. </p>

						<img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/radiofreerichmond/pages/871/attachments/original/1445634068/blogimage.jpg?1445634068" height="300px">
						<br/>
						<p>My family and I moved to the U.S. from Mexico seeking the American Dream. Since we were (and still are) low-income immigrants, we moved to the most affordable housing we could find nearby. Thus, we moved to Richmond. Here, my family and I have had trouble settling in due to the violence in the community. Our van has been stolen and shot at; we still have a bullet-hole in the hood that now serves as a constant reminder that we aren&rsquo;t safe. </p>
						<p>Nevertheless, we have found many opportunities living here, for which we are grateful. I took it upon myself to express this gratitude by directing and implementing two meaningful community projects in Richmond. The first was Citywide Pride, a beautification project meant to promote pride in our community and debunk negative stereotypes. </p>
						<p>The next had a similar objective but with different methodology: RichWhat was a talent show meant to promote positivity. I worked with the ESC of Richmond for both events. I have contributed vastly to the community and hope to continue to do so. </p>
						<p>In school, I have served both as a leader and a scholar. I have a 4.24 GPA and will pursue a higher education. My career plan is to be a software engineer. Despite obstacles, I have worked hard and remained determined to reach that goal. However, that does not mean that the obstacles have gone away. </p>
						<p>My family continues to struggle financially and will most likely not be able to fully fund my education. I hope the City Council agrees to include charter schools in the Richmond Promise, because we, too, are Richmond residents with dreams/challenges and we deserve equal opportunities. </p>

						<img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/radiofreerichmond/pages/857/attachments/original/1445284327/blogimage.jpg?1445284327" height="300px">
						<br/>
						<p>I have lived over 90% of my life in Richmond. I have seen and experienced events that have changed my life, for the better and for the worse. </p>
						<p>By living in Richmond there have been many setbacks that I have faced. For example, gang violence, shootings, robberies, drugs and domestic violence. Those setbacks haven&rsquo;t just affected me physically, but also affected my educational career and future. </p>
						<p>Despite the environment that I have grown up in, there have not been many opportunities to better my life. I am not just the only student that has faced setbacks. </p>
						<p>So, in my opinion, only including traditional public schools in the Richmond Promise is completely absurd. We all have the same dreams, which is to graduate from high school and attend college. Students should be included in the Richmond Promise no matter what type of school they attend, because deep down, we are all students that want to better our lives. The benefits that scholarships give to students are incredible. They wouldn&rsquo;t just help me financially, but by taking away some of the stress that I have with trying to come up with money for my education, it allows me to expand my knowledge by experiencing new things, which would not be possible without the help from scholarships. </p>
